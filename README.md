# Capstone-Project---Prosthetic-Hand
Two PCBs that wirelessly communicate with each other to operate a 3D printed prosthetic hand. Was the lead Hardware Engineer for the project and was responsible for designing the breadboard and PCB prototypes of the project. Two PCBs were made for this project: One called the "Flex Sensor PCB" that powers the flex sensors and ESP-32 on a lipo battery, and one called the "Servo PCB" that powers a mini servo motor, ESp-32, and MCU using a lipo battery.
