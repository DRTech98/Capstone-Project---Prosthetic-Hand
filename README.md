# Capstone-Project-Prosthetic-Hand
Two PCBs that wirelessly communicate with each other to operate a 3D printed prosthetic hand. Was the lead Hardware Engineer for the project and was responsible for designing the breadboard and PCB prototypes of the project. Two PCBs were made for this project: One called the "Flex Sensor PCB" that powers the flex sensors and ESP-32 on a lipo battery, and one called the "Servo PCB" that powers a mini servo motor, ESp-32, and MCU using a lipo battery. Both PCBs recieved power through a 5V USB for charing and the Servo PCB uses a TPS61322 boost converter to take the 3.7V from the lipo battery and boost it to 5V at the output. This 5V boosted output is then used to power the servo motor, since 3.7V is not enough to power the motor to rotate. All coding for this project was done in Arduino and was used for the Esp-32s to wirelessy communicate with eachother. Both PCBs were manufacutred from JLCPCB and soldered by hand with a soldering iron. Original CAD files for Servo PCB could not be found on my computer but screenshots of the schematic and layout are included.
